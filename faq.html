    <h2>Platform & Use Cases</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is SyncToScale?</h3>
      <p>

        Learn more about the intent on the <a href="about.html">About</a> page.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Who is SyncToScale designed for?</h3>
      <p>
        Teams in RevOps, People Ops, Customer Success, Technical Account Management, and any group that relies on connected SaaS systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do I need coding skills?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Workflows use a simple, human-readable logic pattern and require no engineering background.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- CATEGORY: WORKFLOWS -->
    <h2>Workflows & Automation</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do automations work?</h3>
      <p>
        Every automation follows a structured pattern: <strong>Trigger → Conditions → Actions</strong>.  
        Example: Creating a new hire profile can automatically open tickets, create onboarding tasks, and send welcome messages.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can workflows manage errors or exceptions?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The system includes modeled examples of failed field mappings, API rate limits, retry logic, and troubleshooting steps.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can workflows span multiple applications?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. Examples include Salesforce → Slack, HRIS → Jira, Google Workspace → Notion, and other realistic cross-app sequences.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- CATEGORY: INTEGRATIONS -->
    <h2>Integrations & Data</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Which apps are supported?</h3>
      <p>
        Demo integrations include Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Jira, Google Workspace, Notion, and common tools in modern SaaS ecosystems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How does data syncing work?</h3>
      <p>
        Data movement is modeled using real integration standards: field mapping, transformations, deduplication, and update rules across connected systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Are these integrations live?</h3>
      <p>
        No. They are conceptual to demonstrate workflow reasoning and automation design—not production API endpoints.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- CATEGORY: AI ASSISTANT -->
    <h2>SyncBot Nova (AI Assistant)</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What can SyncBot Nova do?</h3>
      <p>
        Nova explains workflow behaviors, answers technical questions, simulates troubleshooting, and showcases the value of AI-augmented TAM/CSM support.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How was Nova built?</h3>
      <p>
        Nova uses a curated internal knowledge set that includes platform features, sample APIs, error frameworks, and reasoning patterns.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is Nova directly connected to automations?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Nova simulates support logic rather than executing workflows—designed to model what an AI layer inside a SaaS platform could provide.
      </p>
    </div>
