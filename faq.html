    <!-- CATEGORY: PLATFORM -->
    <h2>Platform & Use Cases</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is SyncToScale?</h3>
      <p>
        SyncToScale is an automation platform concept that demonstrates how workflows, integrations, and no-code systems work together in modern SaaS environments.
        It models real-world tools like Zapier, Workato, and Tray.io.  
        To learn why this project was built, visit the <a href="about.html">About page</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Who is SyncToScale for?</h3>
      <p>
        RevOps, People Ops, Customer Success, Technical Account Managers, and internal SaaS teams who need clean, automated processes between their systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do I need any coding skills?</h3>
      <p>No coding required. Workflows are designed with clear, human-readable steps accessible to business and technical users alike.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- CATEGORY: WORKFLOWS -->
    <h2>Workflows & Automation</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do workflows work?</h3>
      <p>
        All automations follow a simple model: <strong>Trigger → Conditions → Actions</strong>.  
        Example: A new hire created in the HRIS triggers auto-creation of onboarding tasks, IT tickets, and Slack messages.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I handle edge cases and errors?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The project simulates things like error states, retry logic, field-mapping failures, and troubleshooting steps to model realistic workflows.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can workflows run across multiple apps?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes—examples include Salesforce → Slack, HRIS → Jira, Google Workspace → Notion, and more, showing how multi-app logic works together.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- CATEGORY: INTEGRATIONS -->
    <h2>Integrations & Data</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Which apps can SyncToScale connect to?</h3>
      <p>
        Demo integrations include Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Jira, Google Workspace, Asana, Notion, and similar tools common in SaaS tech stacks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How does data syncing work?</h3>
      <p>
        Data sync is modeled using industry best practices: field mapping, data transforms, deduplication, and cross-system update rules.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Are the integrations live?</h3>
      <p>No. Integrations are conceptual to demonstrate workflow logic and technical thinking, not to provide production API access.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- CATEGORY: AI ASSISTANT -->
    <h2>SyncBot Nova (AI Assistant)</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What can SyncBot Nova do?</h3>
      <p>
        Nova explains workflow behavior, answers technical questions, simulates troubleshooting, and helps demonstrate TAM/CSM problem-solving.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How was Nova trained?</h3>
      <p>
        Nova uses curated system knowledge—platform features, example APIs, errors, and reasoning logic—to mimic a real AI assistant for SaaS users.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Is Nova connected to the workflows?</h3>
      <p>
        Not in production. It simulates support logic rather than executing workflows, showcasing how AI can enhance TAM/CSM operations.
      </p>
    </div>
